3rd August 2006

Thanks to Robert Pointon :
Added curved boxes with gradient.
Better hit detection for bezier spline.
Can now drag the 'end' of a lace so that it breaks the last connection and recontinues the drag.

Thanks to Edouard Fischer :
Better rounded corners of boxes.
Changed names : no more 'strings' (except NSStrings), we now have 'holes' for inputs and outputs in a box, and 'laces' to connect them.
Holes are now a NSDictionary with 3 objects : a label, an EFView and a position.
Laces are now a NSDictionary with 2 objects : a startHole and an endHole.
